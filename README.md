Arachnophilia is a mod that makes spiders better and will be updated as time goes on.

The mod currently adds one "new" feature:
## Spiders will string up cocoons as part of their nest building without needing to kill players first

*”…they weren’t part of our crew… must’ve been left behind.*

## The mod makes spiders highly configurable:
- Spider speed when chasing the player and while setting up the nest.
- Spider damage and health.
- Min/Max webs.
- Min/Max web length.
- Min web distance from one another.
- Three values for web placement speed.
- Two values related to extra cocoons.
